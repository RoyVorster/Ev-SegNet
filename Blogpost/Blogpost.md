# EV-SegNet: Semantic Segmentation for Event-based Cameras

<b><i> 
ABSTRACT
</i></b>

## Background Information
### Event-based cameras
### Semantic pixel level image segmentation
### Original method

## Reproduction
[philosophy: make the method robust for modern day]  

[What we did : 

- [ ] Replicated: A full implementation from scratch without using any pre-existing code.

- [x] Reproduced: Existing code was evaluated

- [ ] Hyperparams check: Evaluating sensitivity to hyperparameters.

- [x] New data: Evaluating different datasets to obtain similar results.

- [ ] New algorithm variant: Evaluating a slightly different variant.

- [x] New code variant: Rewrote or ported existing code to be more efficient/readable.

- [ ] Ablation study: Additional ablation studies.
